# LessCurse

Simple terminal-based ncurses UIs.

LessCurse is a work-in-progress, but it's unclear how much work and how much progress will happen/is needed.

It will probably just be developed enough to serve as a dead-simple TUI for the trackt time-tracking system.

Im happy about bug reports and ideas, but chances are high that I cannot react in the way I wish others would do.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lesscurse'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lesscurse

## Usage

See the examples folder for now.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle` to install dependencies. You can also run `bundle console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
